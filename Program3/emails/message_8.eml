Team,

Please mark your calendars for our upcoming All Call on June 28th.
(Far in advance? Yes. On the plus side, it's free on everyone's
calendars!)

We'll be broadcasting virtually, but we're also able to host up to
25 people in the Auditorium, so if you're in the office that day
we hope to see you there. Our focus will be People and Synergy --
we'll talk about the new Tech Team internal jobs board, feedback
from the last All Call, introduce some new faces, and highlight some
cool collaborations between us and Marketing and Strategy that have
had exceptional results.

Now a bribe -- we are offering cool OOPS swag in exchange for
submission of questions ahead of time. What a deal! We'll also be
running a photo montage of our team before and after the meeting.
Submit your questions or photos of activities, places, people, or pets
to Kim and Samir by June 21st. See the attached puppy photo for an
example. :)

As always, thank you all for your dedication and hard work!

Lester
