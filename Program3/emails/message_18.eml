Team!

Just wanted to put this back on everyone's radar, please be sure
to login and periodically check the Help Desk.

This is the channel for the customers to directly reach out for help,
troubleshooting, questions, etc. I know things are a bit odd, but I
don't want us dropping the ball on customer issues.

Thanks!!
